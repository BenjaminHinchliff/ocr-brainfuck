# OCR Brainfuck Encoder

A ~~small~~ tool that can convert 1-line brainfuck programs to a string with reasonable accuracy (about 90% per character at time or writiing).
I plan to improve that in the future with more data and maybe some data augmentation techniques, or maybe even a better model. This'll do for now though.
Currently works best with black characters on a white background (see examples directory).
